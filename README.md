# Wifi Pentesting

Pair of scripts to get rid of the most annoying part of dealing with hardware manipulation
and that is the whole interaction with the IO's and usb ports if you are lucky, 
if `$USER` permissions are not right or even able to interact with those ports you end up 
spending lot of time typing the same commands, that's why I learned a little bash to automate this steps.

Less `arimon-ng check kill` and more `hashcat -w 3 -m 22000 hash.hc22000 <YOURwordLIST>`
