# NICREFRESHER

# READ CAREFULLY

## nicrefresher is just for health of your network card
## setnicsback2norm is to set network card address back to default
## DBestMonitorModesetup is a script to change devices mac, setup monitor mode and kill processes interfering for Wifi Investigation

### For lack of a better nameit will stay like that. While doing and practicing pentesting and network administration is very common that our network internal card
### starts to behave not the usual way. It could be for a lot of reasons is beyond the scope of this repo and explanation. So when this happens the smart and easy way is to
### grab your NIC clean it and some how like restart it. This is what this small script does, puts down the network interface card the right way, changes it Macaddress
### for a new one and very important it picks one of the same family or kind of device. When you set your devices address to a random one for a quick fix its okay, what almost no one tells you is that if you forget you set that to other thing like a Dishwasher it will have an impact on how your device behaves and even performs. I've heard of brick cards
### but I've never confirmed this. Lets just use nicrefresher and forget about it.

### This repo will be adding other elements in time, the goal is to end with an automated script and a well long live pentesting network card.
